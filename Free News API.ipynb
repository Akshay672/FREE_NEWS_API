      "Summary:  At this time of the year, we usually hear many expert opinions and predictions about the biggest trends for the coming new year. The same goes for my profession, data science as well. However, this time, instead of reading review articles, I decided to ask this crucial question to Open AI's GPT-3 text completion engine. Here comes the answer, unchanged, unedited, and probably provoking a few questions.The seed sentence was the following: 'Top data science trends in 2022.'GPT-3's top 10 prediction:The data science rends in 2022 are likely to be quite different from the trends today.\n",

The main headline from Wellcome's Global Monitor 2020: Covid-19 survey was that global public trust in science and scientists grew during the pandemic. The largest of its kind, the survey covered 119 000 people in 113 countries, and seems to suggest that, after a year of heightened exposure to scientists, and with the first COVID-19 vaccines hailed as a scientific triumph, the value of science might not have eroded as badly as the common narrative—of rising infodemics, vaccine hesitancy, protests against public health measures, and populist politicians—implies.\n",

That's on top of more than 3,500 jobs, most for which hiring has not begun, announced in 2020.  Covid-related furloughs have mostly ended, and only five Triad employers filed WARN notices with the Department of Commerce, reflecting 593 jobs lost. All that would ordinarily be nothing but positive news, but as employers continue to feel the post-pandemic hiring pinch, competition to fill all those jobs will be fierce.\n",

Back in 2018, a company tied to the firm purchased the RTP acreage near the intersection of Davis Drive and Interstate 540. And buzz was high on Jones Street that the state would win the trophy project. But when Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) instead announced plans to put a $1 billion investment in Austin, Texas, channels went quiet.\n",
